# kNN-Regression-Algorithm

The k-Nearest neighbor algorithms for regression is implemented in the KNeighborsRegressor 
class in scikit-learn. The use is similar to that of KNeighborClassifier.

Type in the following code snippet to build the model and run it in a loop:

The code snippet here splits the dataset and runs it in a loop to determine the optimum level 
of k - neighbor for enhancing accuracy. The plt.show() finally creates the plot to 
help us determine the best value of k. Following is a screenshot of the plot:
